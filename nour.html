            <h3>Johann Sebastian Bach was born on March 31, 1685, in Eisenach, a town in Thuringia, Germany. He died on July 28, 1750, in Leipzig, a city in the same region. </h3>
         
                <p class="paragraphmain" style="border: 1px dashed black; padding: 10px;">        Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period, born on March 31, 1685, in Eisenach, Thuringia. He was born into a musical family and became a choirboy at the age of nine, receiving his early musical training from his father, Johann Ambrosius Bach, and his uncle, Johann Christoph Bach.
               As a young man, Bach held various musical positions, including organist at churches in Arnstadt and Mühlhausen, court musician in Weimar, and music director in Köthen. He also composed a large body of music, including sacred and secular works, chamber music, orchestral suites, and keyboard music, such as his famous <em>Well-Tempered Clavier</em>.
                Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) was a prolific and influential German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He was born into a musical family, with several generations of musicians preceding him, and showed early promise as a keyboard player and composer.</p>
