    <p class="mission"> Our mission with this website is to present the importance of livelihood and mental wellbeing in the lives of refugees. It's a common idea that many a-time refugees lack basic survival needs and thus are in a constant state of survival, but in Jordan especially, 45% of refugees are considered "food-poor" and live on 3 jd a day (Tayseer). This means most of their money is used on survival needs with a complete and utter lack of mental health improvement and academic oppurtunities. This leaves the hopeful and ambitious young minds to live dreamless lives in which basic and fundamental needs and rights are non-existant. during our team's meeting with Collateral Repair Project Refugees, We got to know refugees that could not find an education anywhere, afford medication, find refuge in another country, afford books, afford sports gear, afford musical instruments, or even find a job. Despite the fact that they are considered "lucky" and have the significant support of CRP's education and relative social haven, it still cannot suffice the full integration of them into systems of financial, emotional, and physical safety. CRP does a fantastic job with easing the hardships of refugees and spreads a noble and righteous cause in our ever-dimming societal structures and sustainable humanity. We made this multi-media website just to show a glimse in the lives of a handful of refugees and the buffer zones they encounter in Jordan. This highlights the sheer necessity of CRP and for us privelaged communities to be constant monetary supporters.</p>
