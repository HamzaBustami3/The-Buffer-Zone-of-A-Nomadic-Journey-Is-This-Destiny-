                    <p class="under">A devout fish enthusiast, Ahmad has a funny, sensitive, and conscious soul. "You see, Meat will surely raise your cholesteral, not fish. Fish is great for you. And its delicious. Yahya likes KFC though." Ahmad Sabri Kareem is a 42 year old who has been in Amman for 10 years. Originally from Iraq, he moved away to Jordan where he lives with his wife and son. He talks very negatively about the way people treat others in Iraq. "You see, people here, they treat others correctly and righteously. Back in Iraq people are treated like Animals." He worked initially in construction, but is currently struggling to find a consistent job. His son Yahya is getting quality education at CRP and despite learning difficulties is able to read and write. Yahya is currently taking courses in math, english, and arabic. He is very fond of Football and books. In their future,  Ahmad and his family would like to go to Australia because they have family there. Ahmad additionally wants his son Yahia to live a vibrant and free life in a land of very good education.
                        A brief snippet from our conversation with them:
                        "What are your plans for the future?"
                        "We would love to move on to Austrailia, Jordan is great but Australia would have family and great education"
                        "So where do you see yourself in 10 years?"
                        "Australia." Ahmad said, followed by collective giggles and smiles.
                        Unfortunately, his close relative in Jordan is very sick and requires immediate treatment in the hospital, but due to lack of money cannot afford the treatment. Donate to CRP to help Ahmad and allow his dreams and journeys to never wither.

For many years the West Bank has been encountering harsh occupation and has caused conditions to be suffocating in many regions. Diyaa loves Real Madrid and Ronaldo and wishes himself to become a professional football player in Spain one day. "My favorite positions to play are goalee and attacker". As a religious Muslim, he deeply misses the Al aqsa mosque, a revered holy place of worship in islam. He says its his "favorite part of home". Diyaa, symbolically standing afront the library, is an avid bookworm.
                        "Whats your favorite type of book? Non-fiction or fiction?"
                        "I love it all" 
                        The war in Gaza post-October 7th has had a tremendous impact on Diyaa's mental health and every day he prays for the victory of the oppressed over the oppressers. He wishes to eventually form the backcover of his book and return to his home in Palestine once "it's liberation commences".

In Iraq, she was woken up in the middle of the night by loud bangs and sirens just to find out that her house was on fire. Her life and memories were tangibly fading away and crumbling right infornt of her. She was later informed that her dearest friend unfortunately perished due to the bombing. She was devastated and impacted deeply by life-changing shock. Now in CRP with her family, in spite of all the chaos that has occurred during her life, she is active, social and kind to those around her. She loves music deeply and uses it as an outlet for her trauma in the form of beautiful sound. A healing and refuge from the scarred inner-world. Both Mariam and Malak deeply enjoy the distinguished CRP piano program where they delve deep into all kinds of music and create their own at the keyboard. </p>

The only opportunity for his kids is CRP, as they can't get education anywhere else. Life in Jordan is hard for him compared to America and Libya. He has a PhD but can’t get a job. In Jordan, he feels he has no right to do anything. Initially seeking refuge from Libya, he found his way into Jordan.
